# Improving SIMBICON for Biped Animation
Master's project based on [SIMBICON](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/papers/Simbicon.htm) controller

## Set up

Java Version

+ ***[1.8.0](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)***

External Java libraries needed and provided

+ ***[Jama-1.0.3](https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/doc/)***
+ ***[commons-math3-3.6.1](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/javadocs/api-3.6.1/index.html)*** 

## Run the demo

In order to compile and run the applet, we recommend using IDE Eclipse Java (Version. 2019-09) with JRE 1.8.0.
Provided Java jar files should be added to the build path automatically. Applet can be initiated by running **`JSimbicon/src/Simbicon.java`** in Eclipse.

Steps to start the demo in Eclipse:

+ Click **`File > New > Java Project`**, enter a Project name, and click **`Browse...`** to select **`JSimbicon`** folder.
+ Open file **`JSimbicon/src/Simbicon.java`**, and run

## Simulation mode and control

You can use the top slider and buttons to change the simulation speed, and start, pause, or reset the simulation.
You can also do PCA analysis on the generated motion.
In order to record keyframes, a folder named **`stills`** has to be created in project folder prior to the simulation.

Keybinds:

* Ground type (changing ground type during simulation also resets the simulation):
  * flat: **`1`** (default)
  * downward steps and slope: **`2`**
  * upward steps and slope: **`3`**
* Push force:
  * forward push: right arrow key
  * backward push: left arrow key
* Controller (some controller transitions are allowed during simulation):
  * improved walking with ground-feedback: **`n`** (default)
  * SIMBICON walking: **`w`**
  * SIMBICON slow running: **`r`**
  * SIMBICON crouch walking: **`c`**
  * SIMBICON high-step: **`h`**
  * generalized walking without ground-feedback: **`f`**
  * walking generated by PCA: **`p`**
